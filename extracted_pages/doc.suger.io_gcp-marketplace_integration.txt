Suger relies on
workload identity federation
to get access to integrate & manage your GCP Marketplace. Follow the steps below to prepare resources required for Suger integration.

Authenticate Service Account
. Run the command in your GCP cloud shell to authenticate the Service Account to create the pub/sub topic.

Enable Workload Identity Federation on GCP Project

Service Account
and access resources on your Google Cloud Marketplace. Here is the
official guideline
. You can name the Workload Identity Pool with
suger-wip
.
Add Suger AWS as Identity Provider
. Get the Suger AWS Account ID from inquerying
support@suger.io
and add it as
Identity Provider
to the
Workload Identity Pool
(created in Step 2). You can name the Identity Provider with
suger-aws-ip
.
Connect Service Account with Workload Identity Pool
. This step allows Suger to impersonate the
Service Account
via the
Workload Identity Federation
. Go to the details page of the
Workload Identity Pool
(created in Step 2), click
GRANT ACCESS
, select the
Service Account
(created in Step 4) and save.
After saving
Grant access to service account
, there will be a dialog pop-up, as shown below. Select the
Identity Provider
(created in Step 3).
Download config json with content like:
{
"type": "external_account",
"audience": "//iam.googleapis.com/projects/***/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/***/providers/***",
"subject_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:aws:token-type:aws4_request",
"service_account_impersonation_url": "https://iamcredentials.googleapis.com/v1/projects/-/serviceAccounts/***@***.iam.gserviceaccount.com:generateAccessToken",
"token_url": "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/token",
"credential_source": {
"environment_id": "aws1",

"regional_cred_verification_url": "https://sts.{region}.amazonaws.com?Action=GetCallerIdentity&Version=2011-06-15"
}
}
Grant the Workload Identity Pool principle

Edit Integration
​
Editing an existing GCP integration is not supported. The practical way is to delete it and then re-connect it with new inputs.
Delete Integration
​
The GCP integration can be deleted like all other integrations. Once the deletion is triggered, all integration info  will be deleted immediately & permanently from Suger. No time window or methods to recover.
Grant Suger GCP User Account
​
The GCP Marketplace currently does not provide comprehensive API capabilities for operations. To enhance the ability of Suger on your behalf in managing the GCP Marketplace efficiently, we recommend granting the 'Suger GCP User Account' specific IAM roles within your
GCP project
. These roles include
Viewer of the Project
Commerce Producer Admin
Commerce Price Management Private Offers Admin
Consumer Procurement Entitlement Manager
Consumer Procurement Order Administrator
If you wish to enable Suger to support resell offer discounts (CPPO), it is advisable to provide the 'Suger GCP User Account' with additional IAM roles within your
GCP organization
(Not the GCP Project). These roles are:
Commerce Business Enablement Configuration Admin
Commerce Business Enablement Reseller Discount Admin
Commerce Producer Admin
By assigning these roles strategically, you empower Suger with the necessary permissions to effectively manage and optimize GCP Marketplace operations on your behalf.
