Usage Credit
Give usage credits to your clients in cloud marketplaces
Overview
​
The ISV sellers can offer usage credits (in amount, default currency USD) to their clients (buyers) in the active Entitlements of all marketplaces. It provides flexibility for your sales or revenue operation team to customize deal & incentives.
danger
The Suger Usage Credit is applicable
ONLY
for usage-based metering. If the Entitlement has no usage-based metrics defined, the Usage Credit has no effect at all.
warning
If your current metering service supports the credit, don't use it together with Suger Usage Credit, otherwise it may result in double credits.
Billing Priority
​
Credit is just one of multiple available incentives. For example, In Azure Marketplace, each metering metric can have included quantity or even infinite included quantity. In GCP Marketplace, the metric may have free tiered quantity. In addition, some Entitlements are type of commit + usaged-based combined, which has commit amount to consume. To eliminate confusion, they are ordered by their billing priorities in the table below. The
Suger Credit
is consumed first, then
Commit
, and the
Included Quantity
is the last.
