Quick Start Guide for Suger Go SDK
Follow these steps to get started with the Suger Go SDK:
Step 1: Install the SDK
​
To include the Suger SDK in your project, you can clone new release version of the SDK in your terminal:
git clone https://github.com/sugerio/suger-sdk-go.git
Put the package under your project folder and add the following in import:

"github.com/sugerio/suger-sdk-go"
Step 2: Set up your configuration and Create ApiClient
​
Once you have added the package, you can create a configuration. Here’s how to do it:
import

}
apiClient
