Okta SSO
Manage users with Okta OIDC SSO + SCIM provisioning.
Suger supports
Okta
as an identity provider, allowing you to manage users and their access to Suger through Okta.
You can either integrate Suger via Okta Integration Network(OIN), or create custom app integrations.
(Option 1: Recommended) Suger App in Okta Integration Network(OIN)
​
Suger is available on the Okta Integration Network. It supports both
OIDC Single Sign-On (SSO)
and user provisioning with
SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)
.
Add Suger to your Okta account using either of these methods:
Visit the
Suger OIN App page
directly.
Navigate through your
Okta Admin Console
by going to
Applications
→
Applications
→
Browse App Catalog
, then search for "Suger".
Set the following parameters as
placeholders
that will be updated later. Click
Done
when finished.
Suger Organization ID
:
SugerOrg
. (This will be updated later)
SCIM endpoint URL
:
https://www.suger.io/
. (This will be updated later)
Application Visibility
: Keep the default settings (both unchecked)
Configure
OIDC
and
SCIM
following the instructions below.
OIDC configuration
​
Supported Features
​
Service Provider (SP)-Initiated Authentication: Triggered when a user logs in from Suger and uses Okta as the identity provider..
Identity Provider (IdP)-Initiated Authentication: Triggered when a user logs in from Okta and is automatically signed into Suger.
Steps
​
In the Okta app, navigate to
Sign On - Settings
, copy the
Client ID
and
Client Secret
and send them to Suger Support.
Copy your
Okta Domain
and send to Suger Support. It looks like
dev-12345678.okta.com
.
Wait for Suger Support to configure the OIDC connection using the provided details. The following configurations will be set up:
Suger OIDC Configuration
(Operation by Suger Support)
Suger SCIM Configuration
(Operation by Suger Support)
After completing the setup, Suger Support will provide you with the following details:
Suger Organization ID
SCIM endpoint URL
SCIM API Token
In the Okta app, navigate to
General - App Settings
, and update the following parameters with the first two details from the previous step:
The overall data exchange between Okta administrator and Suger Support looks like:
SP-initiated SSO
​
Open your browser and navigate to:
https://console.suger.io/login?orgId={your_suger_org_id}
. After your first successful login, a shortcut will appear on the main login page (
https://console.suger.io/login
) where you can simply click
"SSO to (your organization name)"
to access your account.
Click
"Continue with Okta"
to authenticate with your Okta credentials. (Note: If your organization has configured Okta as the default SSO connection, this step will be automatically skipped.)
Complete the authentication process:
If you're not currently logged into Okta, you'll be prompted to enter your Okta username and password.
If you're already logged into Okta, you'll be automatically redirected to the Suger Console dashboard.
Note
​
important
Once the integration is set up,
Okta becomes the sole source of user management
, replacing manual management in the Suger console.
To ensure seamless user provisioning and management, make sure you have also configured
SCIM
.

Steps
​
Open the app and navigate to
Provisioning
, click
"Configure API Integration"
.
Check the
Enable API Integration
box.
Enter the
API Token
provided by Suger Support, then click
Test API Credentials
to verify the connection. If the verification is successful, click

:
In
Provisioning to App
section, check the options below:
Set up Suger Role mapping following
Manage Suger Role with SCIM
.
Troubleshooting
​
"Conflict" or "Matching user not found" error
If you encounter this error when assigning users to the SCIM app, navigate to
Dashboard > Tasks
to check the error details and retry the task.
User provisioning
After a user is provisioned, they will gain access to the Suger console immediately.
The user will not be visible in the Suger console until they complete their first login via OIDC authentication.
SCIM provisioning for
sugerRole
updates
To apply
sugerRole
updates, log out and then log back into the Suger console.
Updates to
sugerRole
may take a few minutes to reflect due to caching. Please wait a while and try again.
Synced user attributes
Only
email
and
sugerRole
are synchronized.
Changes to the family name and given name will
NOT
be reflected in the Suger console.
User deprovisioning
After a user is un-provisioned, they will lose access to the Suger console upon their next login attempt. However, they can continue accessing the Suger console until their current session expires.
The user will still be visible in the Suger console, and removal may take up to
24 hours
.
If you have any further questions or difficulties with your integration, please contact
Suger support
at
support@suger.io
.
(Option 2) Create custom app integrations
​
You can also create custom app integrations for Suger in Okta, which provides more flexibility and control over the configuration.
This section describes how to create two separate Okta apps for OpenID Connect(OIDC) and SCIM provisioning.
Create an OpenID Connect(OIDC) App Integration
​
Setting up Okta as a Single Sign-On (SSO) provider for Suger requires configuration on both
Okta
and
Suger
sides.
Okta OIDC Configuration
​
Follow these steps to create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) app integration in Okta:
Open the
Okta Admin Console
, go to
Applications
->
Applications
. Click
Create App Integration
.
Select
OIDC
as the Sign-in method, and
Web application
as the Application type:
Configure the following parameters, then click
Save
.:
App integration name
:
Suger
Sign-in redirect URIs
:
https://dev-uwmvi0yu.us.auth0.com/login/callback
.
Sign-out redirect URIs
:
https://console.suger.io/login
.
Trusted Origins
:
https://console.suger.io
Open the app settings and navigate to
General - General Settings - Edit
, then configure the following:
Login initiated by
: Either Okta or App
Application visibility
: Display application icon to users

"Save"
.
Create an SCIM App Integration
​
SCIM (
System for Cross-domain Identity Management
) enables secure user data synchronization between
Okta
and
Suger
.
Setting up SCIM integration requires configuration on both
Suger
and
Okta
sides.
Suger SCIM Configuration
​
Open the
Auth0 Dashboard
and navigate to:
Authentication > Enterprise > Okta Workforce > [your-connection] > Provisioning
.
Configure the following settings:
Disable
: "Sync user profile attributes at each login".
Enable
: "Sync user profiles using SCIM.
In the
Mapping
tab, add this mapping:
{
"scim": "roles[type eq \"SUGER_ROLE\"].value",
"auth0": "app_metadata.suger_role"
},
In the
Setup
tab, Generate a
Bearer Token
using the default settings:
Send the
SCIM endpoint URL
and
Bearer token
to the Okta administrator.
Okta SCIM Configuration
​
Obtain the
SCIM endpoint URL
and
Bearer token
from Suger Support.
Follow this
Okta SCIM setup guide
to create a SCIM app:
Manage Suger Role with SCIM
​
Create a
custom attribute
for SCIM app user:
Data type
:
string
Display name
:
Suger Role
Variable name
:
sugerRole
External name
:
roles.^[type=='SUGER_ROLE'].value
External namespace
:
urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User
Enum
: Define enumerated list of values
Attribute members
:
ADMIN
:
ADMIN
EDITOR
:
EDITOR
VIEWER
:
VIEWER
Attribute required
: Yes
Attribute type
: Group
After creation, it looks like:
Create
Okta Groups
for each
Suger Role
and assign them to the SCIM app.
Example: Create
Suger Role Admin
group:
Assign the group to the SCIM app with
Suger Role
configured:
Repeat for
Editor
and
Viewer
roles:
Open the SCIM app, map the
Suger Role
attribute in the
Provisioning
tab::
Click "edit" icon, and set the mapping as follows:
After mapping:
Manage Users Access
​
Assign the users or Suger role groups to Suger App. If you're using separated custom apps, assign the Suger role groups to both the Okta SSO app and the SCIM app.
To grant a user access to Suger, assign the user to a Suger role group.
To revoke access, remove the user assignments from a Suger role group.
Note
:
warning
If you encounter a
"Conflict"
or
"Matching user not found"
error when assigning users to the SCIM app, please contact Suger Support to remove the existing Okta connection users in Auth0.
