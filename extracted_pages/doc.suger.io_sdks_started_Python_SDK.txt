Quick Start Guide for Suger Python SDK
Follow these steps to get started with the Suger Python SDK:
Step 1: Install the SDK
​
To include the Suger SDK in your project, you can use pip in your terminal:
pip install suger-sdk-python==latest.version
Step 2: Set up your configuration and Create ApiClient
​
Once you have added the package, you can create a configuration. Here’s how to do it:
import
suger_sdk_python
from
suger_sdk_python
import
Configuration
config
=
suger_sdk_python
.
Configuration
(
host
=

[

.
ApiClient

offer_id
=
'your_offer_id'
try
:
result
=
OfferApi
(
api_client
)
.
get_offer
(
org_id
,
offer_id
)
print
(
"The response of OfferApi:\n"
)
print
(

except
