Usage Metering
Unified Usage Metering interface to cover all pricing models crossing all marketplaces
Overview
​
There are varies of pricing models crossing three cloud marketplaces. Some of them share the same name, but have totally different models. For example,
AWS Subscription
is Pay-as-you-go (usage-based metering), but
GCP Subscription
is flat-monthly-commit without usage-based metering.

Meter Usage Records
​
To meter usages for an active
Entitlement
in
AWS
,
Azure
or
GCP
, your service can send a
POST
request to the
Suger Metering API
with a body similar to the following example. Suger will validate, aggregate & report them to the right vendor within the right pricing model format.
{
"ID": "uuid", # optional, if not provided, suger will generate one and return in the response.
"organizationID": "your-suger-org-id",
"entitlementID": "your-suger-entitlement-id",
"records": {
"dimension-key-or-name-0": 2,
"dimension-key-or-name-2": 6,
"dimension-key-or-name-3": 10,
}
}
warning
It is highly recommended to provide
ID
in the metering usage records request body. Suger service can deduplicate the metering requests if they have the same
ID
. The duplicate request will return HTTP error 409.
The 'key' in the records map can be either the usage metering
Dimension Key
or
Dimension Name
. They are available inside the
WorkloadEntitlement.info.dimensions
.
Batch Meter Usage Records
​
You can efficiently report multiple usage records for various entitlements or buyers simultaneously using either the Suger Console or the
Suger API doc
.
Upload CSV
​
By simply uploading a CSV file containing raw usage data, you can quickly and effortlessly report multiple records. The CSV file should include specific required columns as show below, which are crucial for accurate reporting.
Column Name
Requirements
Description
sugerBuyerId
Only require one of
sugerBuyerId
,
sugerExternalBuyerId
,
customerId
or
sugerExternalEntitlementId
The buyer ID in Suger platform
sugerExternalBuyerId
Only require one of
sugerBuyerId
,
sugerExternalBuyerId
,
customerId
or
sugerExternalEntitlementId
The external buyer ID in Suger platform, which comes from marketplaces
customerId
Only require one of
sugerBuyerId
,
sugerExternalBuyerId
,
customerId
or

The buyer ID in your own system
sugerExternalEntitlementId
Only require one of
sugerBuyerId
,
sugerExternalBuyerId
,
customerId
or
sugerExternalEntitlementId
The external entitlement ID in Suger platform, which comes from marketplaces
dimension
Required
The dimension key used to meter the customer
quantity
Required, float or integer number
The quantity of the usage dimension
timestamp
Optional, must be in format of
YYYY-MM-DD
or ISO 8601
2023-09-07T15:30:00Z
The date/timestamp when the usage were recorded in your metering/billing system. NOT the date/timestamp when the usage are reported to the Suger
Once uploaded, Suger will validate the usage records within the CSV and highlight any invalid entries with corresponding error messages. This ensures that only valid usage records are eligible for batch reporting to Suger.
Limit to Report Old Usage Records
​
Most cloud marketplaces recommend reporting usage records within 1 hour of their metering. However, they do allow some flexibility for reporting older usage records as shown below table. If a usage record has a timestamp later than the official hard limit, the marketplace's metering service will not accept or process it.
warning
To provide a safety margin, the Suger metering service reduces the official limit by one hour..
Usage records with timestamps within the Suger limit are reported with their original timestamp, while those outside this limit are reported with the timestamp of the Suger limit.

Usage Records Validation
​
When the usage records are sent to Suger via the
Suger Metering API
, they are validated immediately, and return errors if they are not valid. Here is the list of all rules used for validation in Suger service, and their returned error.
Rule
Error If Invalid
The
ID
in the request body should be unique
HTTP Conflict request with code 409
The length of
ID
in the request body should not exceed 36
HTTP bad request with code 400
The target
Entitlement
must be in
ACTIVE
,
SUSPENDED
or
PENDING_CANCEL
status
HTTP bad request with code 400
The
Key
in the Record should be valid for the target
Entitlement
. It is either the Dimension Key or the Dimension Name
HTTP bad request with code 400
The
Quantity
in the usage Record should be non-negative
HTTP bad request with code 400
At least one usage Record has positive
Quantity
HTTP bad request with code 400
Metering Dimension Conversion
​
Under certain scenarios below, you may consider to enable & configure
Metering Dimension Conversion
.
The dimension names in your metering system are different from those in cloud marketplaces, and you don't want to change either.
A new metering dimension is added to your product, and you want to meter your existing clients in cloud marketplace, however their entitlements do not include new metering dimension.
By enable & configure
Metering Dimension Conversion
, you can map your dimension keys from your metering system to the cloud marketplace by using multiplier factor.
danger
Once you enable & configure the
Metering Dimension Conversion
for one cloud marketplace, it is applied to all entitlements in this cloud marketplace.
When the Suger metering API receives usage records, it applies a predefined mapping (if it is enabled) to convert the dimensions. Any dimensions that cannot be mapped will be left
unchanged
.
You can map multiple source dimensions to single destination dimensions with different multiplier value.
Commit with Additional Usage Metering
​
In AWS or Azure Marketplace, a contract or entitlement with commit and usage metering doesn't accumulate usage by default, and consumes the commit first. This means that ISVs or sellers have to set up their own metering system to track usage, and report any extra usage to the marketplace if it exceeds the prepaid commit.
To simplify the configuration and remove friction, Suger offers an optional feature called
Commit with additional usage metering
. When enabled, Suger automatically accumulates all usage records and compares them with the commit. If the commit isn't fully used, the usage records won't be reported to the marketplace. Only usage records that exceed the commit are reported to the marketplace. This feature streamlines the process and reduces the need for sellers to set up their own metering system.
How to enable
Commit with additional usage metering
? Visit
Suger Console Settings
and select the
Usage Metering
tab. Click the editing icon to enable or disable the
Commit with additional usage metering
for the target marketplace.
warning
We don't recommend to enable
Commit with additional usage metering
in GCP Marketplace since it hase the native pricing model to support the same function.
Commit with Additional Usage at List Price
​
In both AWS and Azure Marketplaces, the usage metering price is typically the negotiated price after the commit amount has been used up. They do not support metering of extra usage beyond the committed amount at the list price.
To make the configuration process simpler and more streamlined, Suger offers an optional feature called
Commit with Additional Usage at List Price
. When this feature is enabled, Suger automatically adjusts the quantity of received usage records by calculating the ratio of the list price to the negotiated price. This ensures that buyers are billed at the list price for any additional usage beyond the committed amount.
How to enable
Commit with additional usage at list price
? Visit
Suger Console Settings
and select the
Usage Metering
tab. Click the editing icon to enable or disable the
Commit with additional usage at list price
for the target marketplace.
warning
We don't recommend to enable
Commit with additional usage at list price
in GCP Marketplace since it hase the native pricing model to support the same function.
Before enabling
Commit with Additional Usage at List Price
, you must first activate
Commit with Additional Usage Metering
.
Divide Entitlement Commit
​
The GCP, Azure, and AWS Marketplaces do not currently offer support for the pricing model that combines a prepay one-year commitment with monthly overage metering. For instance, a private offer might include a one-year commitment of $120K, paid upfront by the client. The client then receives $10K in credits for prepaid usage each month. If the client's actual usage within a particular month is below $10K, there will be no overage usage metering, and no additional charges will apply. However, if the client's usage exceeds $10K during any month, they will be billed for the overage usage that exceeds the prepaid amount.
Suger introduces the flexibility to divide upfront/parent entitlement commit to multiple sub entitlement terms of credits. So the overage usage can be metered more granularly within each sub entitlement term.
Click the button
Divide Commit
to open the dialog below. Configure the start dates for each sub entitlement terms, and click the button
Divide
.
There are multiple sub entitlement terms created on top of the original upfront/parent entitlement term, with type of
DivideCommit
as shown below.
