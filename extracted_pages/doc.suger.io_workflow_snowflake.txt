Snowflake
Use the Snowflake node to automate work in Snowflake.
Operations
​
Execute an SQL query
​
Use
Execute Query
operation to execute a SQL query.
For example, configure a snowflake node as below:
The result data from the node is:
[
{
"json": {
"CITY": "Meniko",
"EMAIL": "adavidovitsk@sf_tuts.com",
"FIRST_NAME": "Arlene",
"LAST_NAME": "Davidovits",
"START_DATE": "2017-05-03T00:00:00Z",
"STREETADDRESS": "7571 New Castle Circle"
}
},
{
"json": {
"CITY": "Troitsk",
"EMAIL": "vshermorel@sf_tuts.com",
"FIRST_NAME": "Violette",
"LAST_NAME": "Shermore",
"START_DATE": "2017-01-19T00:00:00Z",
"STREETADDRESS": "899 Merchant Center"
}
},
{
"json": {
"CITY": "Bayaguana",
"EMAIL": "rmattysm@sf_tuts.com",
"FIRST_NAME": "Ron",
"LAST_NAME": "Mattys",
"START_DATE": "2017-11-15T00:00:00Z",
"STREETADDRESS": "423 Lien Pass"
}
}
]
Insert records into the database
​
Use
Insert
operation to insert records into the database.
For example, use the result data as input from the
Execute Query
operation above and use a
Code
node to update the
STREETADDRESS
field:
// Loop over input items and update the STREETADDRESS field
for
(
const
item
of
$input
.
all
(
)
)
{
item
.
json
.
STREETADDRESS
=
"New Address"
;
}
return
$input
.
all
(
)
;
Then configure a snowflake node as below:
The result data from the node is:
[
{
"json": {
"success": true
}
}
]
Three new records with columns configured above are inserted into the database with the
STREETADDRESS
field as "New Address".
Update existing records in the database
​
Use
Update
operation to update existing records in the database.
For example, use a
Code
node to generate the data to update the existing records:
return
[
{
FIRST_NAME
:
"jane1"
,
LAST_NAME
:
"doe_updated_11"
}
,
{
FIRST_NAME
:
"jane2"
,
LAST_NAME
:
"doe_updated_22"
}
,
]
;
Then configure a snowflake node as below:
The result data from the node is:
[
{
"json": {
"index": 0,
"success": true
}
},
{
"json": {
"index": 1,
"success": true
}
}
]
All the
Columns
(
LAST_NAME
in this example) of the records that match the
Update Key
(
FIRST_NAME
in this example) are updated with the new values.
