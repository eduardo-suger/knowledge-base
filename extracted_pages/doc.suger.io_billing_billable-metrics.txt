Billable Metrics
Define metrics to track usage and consumption.
The Billable Metrics are used to define the goals and aggregation type of metering.
You can define the metrics according to your business needs, such as the number of API calls, the amount of storage, the number of users, etc.

Filter groups

Filter Groups
are used to filter usage records you reported, only those meet the filtering criteria will participate in the aggregation.
Different groups have an "AND" relationship, while the filters within each group have an "OR" relationship.

Property unique on
​
When selecting
UNIQUE COUNT
as the aggregation type, you need to specify the property to count. And the usage data you reported should contains the specified property.
Group By
​
Group By
will divide usage records reported into different groups according to the specified dimensions. When reporting usage data, the specified dimensions should be used as keys in the properties field of usage records.
info
Each group will be calculated separately by price model.
Currently, a maximum of
3
dimensions are supported for group by.
In the below example, we choose
partner
and
region
as the group by dimensions, if property
partner
in our usage data has the following values:
aws
,
azure
,
gcp
, and property
region
has the following values:
us-east
,
eu-west
, then the usage data will be divided into 6 groups.
