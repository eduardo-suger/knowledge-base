Create Private Offer
You can create and manage all of your Azure Marketplace private offers via Suger Console or API
Overview
​
Private offers let Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and partners in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program grow their revenue by creating time-bound customized margins that suit each entity’s business needs. As an ISV, you can specify the margin and duration to create a wholesale price for your CSP partner. When your partner makes a sale to a customer, Microsoft will make its payments to you off the wholesale price.
There are two price types in the private offer you can select to customize the original price of the plans. They are
Discount Price
and
Absolute Price
.
Discount Price
​
Set a discounted percentage off based on the original price of the plan. For example below:
The
Plan for Growth
is type of
Flat Rate
pricing model.
Its original price is $499 per month + $0.01 per unit for extra usage of
support_unit
.
The private offer price on this plan is 7% off. So the final price after discount is $464.07 per month + $0.0093 per unit for the extra usage of
support_unit
.
Absolute Price
​
Set an absolute price which is quite independent from the original price of the plan. For example below:
The
Plan for Enterprise
is type of
Flat Rate
pricing model.
Its original price is $1999 per month + $0.01 per unit for extra usage of
contract_unit
and $0.01 per unit for extra usage of
support_unit
.
The private offer on this plan is absolute price, which is $9 per month + $0.02 per unit for extra usage of
contract_unit
and $0.01 per unit for extra usage of
support_unit
.

Troubleshoot
​
There are two common failure errors when creating azure private offer.
Reusing a private offer name
. A private offer name cannot be reused if it has already been used in a previous offer, regardless of the status of that offer.
Solution
use a different offer name and re-create the private offer.
Duplicate offers for SAME product and price plan
. A new private offer cannot be created if a previous offer exists with the
same
product and price plan for the
same
Azure billing account ID.
Solution
If the previous offer has been accepted or purchased, there are two options:
Wait for the end of previous offer, and create new offer based on the same product & price plan.
Create new offer based on the same product but different (or new) price plan
If the previous offer has not been accepted, cancel it and create new one.
