Connect Suger to Alibaba Cloud Marketplace - China & International
Overview
​
Alibaba Cloud Marketplace
is a digital platform that connects Alibaba Cloud users with trusted SaaS providers and ISVs worldwide, similar to marketplaces offered by AWS, Azure, and GCP. The Marketplace provides a diverse range of software and services that integrate with Alibaba Cloud's infrastructure solutions.
By connecting Suger to your Alibaba Cloud Marketplace account, we can easily make your product discoverable to Alibaba Cloud customers and enable consolidated billing through Alibaba Cloud accounts. It also facilitates key capabilities like private offers, order management, usage metering, and automated revenue recognition.

Auth Free URL Redirect
​
After an SaaS instance is generated, the buyer might require access to the ISV's back-end system without the need for additional authentication. The process involves the following steps:
The URL request is initially directed to the Suger service.
Within the Suger service, the request undergoes processing and verification through SPI token validation.
Subsequently, the request is redirected to the ISV's product fulfillment URL, accompanied by specific parameters:
sugerEntitlementId
partner
, which is consistently set as
partner=ALIBABA
.
timestamp
, denoting the moment the token was generated, from the Alibaba Cloud Marketplace in UTC formatted as RFC3339.
token
, representing the SPI token utilized for validation. It is generated by Suger using the same SPI key.
Upon reception of the redirected request by your service or frontend, the following steps should be taken to ensure proper validation of the token using the SPI key:
Token Verification: Extract the provided SPI token from the incoming request.
SPI Key Usage: Employ the appropriate SPI key to validate the token obtained from the request.
Timestamp Validation: Confirm that the timestamp included in the parameters aligns with the time of token generation, adhering to the RFC3339 format.
Partner Check: Verify that the partner parameter is set as
partner=ALIBABA
.
Once your service or frontend received the redirected request, please verify the token using the SPI key. Here is the detailed guidance of
SPI security
.
