Delete Execution
Delete unnecessary execution data.
Suger recommends avoiding the storage of unnecessary data to prevent excessive growth of the database.
For instance, execution data generated by a Snowflake node that queries and updates database records typically is not required for subsequent processing, as these operations have already been completed.
Operations
​
This node has no parameters. Just put it at the end of the workflow to delete the execution data.
The execution data will
NOT
be saved and will
NOT
be shown in the
Executions
tab.
