warning
A
Canceled
invoice is
immutable
, meaning it cannot be edited or reissued.
Invoice ID
​
Invoice ID is a stable unique identifier based on the organization ID, entitlement ID, dimension key, and invoice drafted time.
Invoice Types
​
There are four types of invoices:
Commit
,
Installment
,
Usage
, and
Addon
.
Different types of invoices will be generated for different entitlement terms, meaning that one entitlement can include multiple invoices, each of a different type.
For example, if an entitlement includes both
Commitment
and
Billable Dimension(s)
pricing terms, two invoices will be created: one for the
Commitment
and one for the
Billable Dimension(s)
.
Commit Invoice
​
For
Commitment(s)
pricing terms in the entitlement,
Commit
invoices will be created.
Usage Invoice
​
For
Billable Dimension(s)
pricing terms in the entitlement,
Usage
invoices will be created based on the usage record reports.
Usage record reports are generated from Usage record groups reported by the seller on the
Usage Metering
section on the entitlement detail page:
Installment Invoice
​
For
Payment installments
pricing terms in the entitlement,
Installment
invoices will be created.
Addon Invoice
​
Suger enables sellers to charge additional fees to buyers by creating an addon invoice tied to the entitlement.
Sellers can create an addon on "
Settings
-
Addon
" tab and apply an addon by clicking "
Apply Addon
" button on the entitlement detail page:
Invoice Lifecycle
​
The invoice lifecycle consists of the following stages:
Drafting
,
Issuing
and
Payment
.
Drafting
​
An invoice will be automatically created based on its type and entitlement and enters the
DRAFT
status.
Three important dates are involved in the drafting process:
Draft Date
,
Issue Date
, and
Due Date
.
Draft Date
​
The draft date differs from different invoice types:
Commit
: draft date is computed as
below
.
Usage
: draft date is computed as
below
.
Installment
: draft date is the payment installment charge date.
Addon
: draft date is its specified charge date.
Issue Date
​
Issue date is calculated as:
draft date + grace period
.
For example, if the
draft date
is 2025-01-01, and the
grace period
is 7 days, the
issue date
will be 2025-01-08.
Due Date
​
Due date is calculated as:
issue date + net term days
.
For example, if the
issue date
is 2025-01-08, and the
net term days
is 10 days, the
due date
will be 2025-01-18.
Issuing
​
When the invoice issue date is due or the invoice is manually issued, it transits into the
FINALIZED
status.
Notifications emails will be sent to the buyer's contacts when the invoice is issued.
Payment
​
Payment transactions will be automatically made on the invoice due date. After the payment is completed, the invoice is marked as
PAID
.
For details, see
Payment
.
Canceling
​
Once an invoice is canceled, it is marked as
CANCELED
status and will not proceed to payment.
Invoice Period
​
"Invoice period" answers the following questions:
When will an invoice be created?
What's the start date and end date of the invoice?
Invoices periods are calculated based on different invoice types as follows.
Commit invoice period
​
The
Commit
invoice period varies depending on the following factors:
Entitlement's start date:
past
or
future
. If the entitlement start date is in the past, the first invoice may include multiple periods. If the entitlement start date does not cover the full billing period, the invoice will be prorated accordingly.
Billing cycle:
beginning of the month
or
start of the entitlement
.
Payment schedule type:
prepay
or
postpay
The first invoice period is determined as follows:
Entitlement Start Date
Billing Cycle
Payment Schedule
First Invoice Start Date
First Invoice End Date
First Invoice Draft Date

Beginning of the Month
Prepay
Entitlement's start date

Below are the detailed scenarios for the invoice period.
1. Start date in the past
​
If the Entitlement's start date is in the past, the entitlement is considered active.
1.1 If the billing cycle is
beginning of the month
and the payment schedule type is
prepay
, the first invoice
start date is the Entitlement's start date.
end date is the nearest first day of the month.
draft date is today.
1.2 If the billing cycle is

and the payment schedule type is
prepay
, the first invoice
start date is the Entitlement's start date.
end date is the nearest first day of the month.
draft date is the same as the start date.
2.2 If the billing cycle is
beginning of the month
and the payment schedule type is
postpay

start date is the Entitlement's start date.
end date is the nearest first day of the month.
draft date is the same as the end date.
2.3 If the billing cycle is
start of the entitlement
and the payment schedule type is
prepay
, the first invoice
start date is the Entitlement's start date.
end date is the Entitlement's start date in the next period.
draft date is the same as the start date.
2.4 If the billing cycle is
start of the entitlement
and the payment schedule type is
postpay
, the first invoice
start date is the Entitlement's start date.
end date is the Entitlement's start date in the next period.
draft date is the same as the end date.
Usage Invoice Period
​

. If the entitlement start date is in the past, the first invoice may include multiple periods. If the entitlement start date does not cover the full billing period, the invoice will be prorated accordingly.
Billing cycle:
beginning of the month
or
start of the entitlement
.
The first invoice period is determined as follows:
Entitlement Start Date
Billing Cycle
First Invoice Start Date
First Invoice End Date
First Invoice Draft Date

Entitlement's start date
Nearest first day of the month
Same as the end date
Future
Start of the Entitlement
Entitlement's start date
Entitlement's start date in the next period

You can consider the payment schedule type is always
postpay
, and the invoice period is calculated the same way as the Commit invoice above.
Installment Invoice Period
​
It is the specified installment payment date.
Addon Invoice Period
​
It is the specified addon charge date.
Invoice Amount
​
The invoice amount is calculated based on the entitlement terms and different invoice types.
Commit Invoice Amount
​
The
Commit
invoice amount is calculated based on the
Commitment
terms in the entitlement.
Over a period
​
When the entitlement start date is in the past, the first invoice may span multiple billing periods.
For example, if an entitlement's start date is set to 3 months ago but is just being created now, the first invoice will cover all 3 months.
Less than a period
​
For partial billing periods, invoice amounts are prorated based on the actual days of service.
Usage Invoice Amount
​
Usage Charge Fee
will be calculate based on the
Usage record reports
(Hourly reports shown in the red box) to create a
Usage
invoice:
Referring to
Calculate usage invoice fee
for an overview of usage invoice fee calculation.
Minimum Spend
​
Minimum spend will be applied when calculating the dimension amount. The following options in the entitlement will be considered:
Minimum Commit Scope:
DIMENSION
: Minimum commit applies to the entire dimension, including all group bys.
DIMENSION_GROUP_BY
: Minimum commit applies to each dimension group bys.
Minimum Commit Prorated: If set to true, the minimum commit amount will be prorated based on the usage period (starting time and ending time)
Installment Invoice Amount
​
The amount of an Installment invoice is defined by the installment payment terms in the entitlement.
Addon Invoice Amount
​
The amount of an Addon invoice is set by the applied addon amount.
Trial
​
If the entitlement includes a trial period, the invoice amount will exclude the usage during the trial period.
Trial period works for the Commit invoice and Usage invoice.
Commit Invoice Trial Period
​
Commit invoice amount = Amount per day * (Billed days - Trial days)
For example, if an entitlement has the following details:
30 days in a full period.
$300 for a full-period commit.
20 days in the billing cycle.
5 trial days.
The invoice will be calculated as follows:
Amount per day = Full-period amount / Full-period days = $300 / 30 = $10
Billed days = Billed days - trial days = 20 - 5 = 15
Invoice amount = Amount per day * Billed days = $10 * 15 = $150
Usage Invoice Trial Period
​
The usage record reports that are before the trial period will be excluded from the invoice amount calculation.
For example, if an entitlement has the following details:
100 units in total.
20 units in the trial period.
$1 per unit.
The invoice will be calculated as follows:
Billed units = Total units - Trial units = 100 - 20 = 80
Invoice amount = Billed units * Unit price = 80 * $1 = $80
Discount
​
Usage Dimension Discount
​
If the usage dimension includes a discount, the usage charge fee will exclude the discounted amount.
Overall Discount
​
The overall discount will be applied to the final total amount of the invoice, after all other discounts are calculated.
It can be set as a fixed amount or a percentage of the total amount when
editing
the invoice.
