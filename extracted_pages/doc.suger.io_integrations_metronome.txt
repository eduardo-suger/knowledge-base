If you currently rely on
Metronome
as your metering/billing service and are looking to expand your business in cloud marketplaces, Suger offers the ideal solution to bridge the gap. With our no-code, fully automated integration, you can seamlessly meter usages from your existing Metronome instance to clients in all cloud marketplaces. There is no need for migration or extensive engineering efforts, making the process smooth and hassle-free.
When it comes to adopting Suger with Metronome together, you have two options available. However, we highly recommend
Option 2
, and here's why:

Create Integration
â€‹
In your
Suger Console Integration
, you will see the Metronome integration connection. Click the
Connect
button to create an integration with your Metronome instance. This will open an dialog for you to input
API Token
: The
Metronome API token
.
Billing Mode
: Select one of
quantity
,
amount_hourly
or
amount_daily
. Details about their difference can be found
here
Once the integration process is finished, you can proceed by clicking the
VERIFY
button. This action triggers the Suger service to test the connection to the APIs of your Metronome instance. If everything is configured correctly, the integration status will be updated as
VERIFIED
.
Edit Integration
â€‹
Editing an existing Metronome integration is supported. Click the
Edit
button to open the dialog of editing Metronome integration as shown below.
Enable Auto Report Usage
. You can choose to enable or disable the automatic usage report feature for Metronome. Enabling this feature allows Suger to run an hourly cron job to retrieve the aggregated usage events from Metronome and report them as UsageRecordGroups to the
Suger metering API
. On the other hand, disabling this feature means that no cron job will be scheduled for this purpose.
Billing Mode
:
quantity
,
amount_hourly
or
amount_daily
. Details about their difference can be found
here
Enable Billable Metric Whitelist
. If enabled, only the billable metrics in the whitelist will be metered & reported from Metronome to cloud marketplaces. Otherwise all the metrics listed in the
Billable Metric Full List
will be metered & reported to cloud marketplaces.
Billable Metric Whitelist
. Applicable only when the
Enable Billable Metric Whitelist
is true.
Billable Metric Full List
. The full list of billable metrics fetched from Metronome for all available Metronome customers. It is auto fetched from Metronome, not editable.
warning
If the billing mode is
quantity
, please ensure all billable metrics in the
Whitelist
(if the whitelist is enabled) or the
Full List
(if the whitelist is not enabled) have been mapped to their respective cloud marketplace dimensions in the
Metering Dimension Conversion
.
Metronome Auto Fetch & Report Job: In case any billable metrics from Metronome cannot be successfully converted to metering dimensions in the cloud marketplace, it may result in the entire Metronome auto fetch and report job failing.
If you notice any discrepancies or missing usage reporting, please verify whether this is caused by incomplete mapping of billable metrics to cloud marketplace dimensions. If so, rectify the mapping accordingly to ensure accurate reporting.
Delete Integration
â€‹
The Metronome integration can be deleted like all other integrations. Once the deletion is triggered, all integration info including the API token will be deleted immediately & permanently from Suger. No time window or methods to recover.
Billing Mode
â€‹
There are three billing modes available for Suger-Metronome integration:
quantity
,
amount_hourly
or
amount_daily
.
quantity
: Suger fetch & report the billable metrics by quantity every one
HOUR
. Use the original Metronome billable metrics as the source dimension keys in the configuration of
metering dimension conversion
amount_hourly
:  Suger fetch & report
invoice total amount
every one
HOUR
. The
invoice total amount
is converted to the dimension
metronome
with fixed unit price as
$1
. Use
metronome
as the only source dimension key in the configuration of
metering dimension conversion
.
tip
Suger fetches
Metronome Invoice API
every one hour. If there is an increase in the
invoice total amount
, Suger will generate a new usage record and report it to cloud marketplaces. However, if the
invoice total amount
remains the same or decreases, Suger will refrain from creating new usage records..
In cases where credits are granted to the customer in Metronome, resulting in a potential decrease in the
invoice total amount
, Suger retains a comprehensive history of invoice total amounts and monitors any changes. If the
invoice total amount
decreases or remains unchanged, Suger will suspend the automatic fetching and reporting of usage until it surpasses the maximum value recorded in its history.
amount_daily
: Suger fetch & report the
invoice total amount
every one
DAY
. The total amount is converted to the dimension
metronome
with fixed unit price as
$1
. Use
metronome
as the only source dimension key in the configuration of
metering dimension conversion
.
warning
When using the
amount_hourly
or
amount_daily
billing modes, pay attentions to the following:
Suger tracks each invoice amount using the Metronome
invoice ID
and reports increases to the cloud marketplace on an hourly or daily basis. If a customerâ€™s contract is modified or an operation changes the
invoice ID
, Suger will start reporting amounts based on the new invoice ID. This can lead to a sudden spike in the usage report.
To avoid this,
schedule contract changes or similar operations to take effect at the beginning of the month
. This approach minimizes disruptions and ensures a smoother and more consistent usage reporting process.
Connect Metronome Customer
â€‹
To enable Suger to fetch and report the billable metrics of Metronome Customers to the appropriate entitlements in Cloud Marketplace, you need to connect the Buyer in Suger with the corresponding Customer in Metronome. Simply click the
Edit
button in the Buyer and add the corresponding Metronome Customer ID. This setup only needs to be done once; afterward, Suger's service will automatically retrieve the latest billable metrics and report them to the correct Cloud Marketplace entitlements.
