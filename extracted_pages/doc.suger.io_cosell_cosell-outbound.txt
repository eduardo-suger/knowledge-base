Share opportunities from your CRM with partners
Overview
​
With your co-sell configurations, sharing with partners can be as easy as a few mouse clicks.
Outbox
​
Outbox is the place to show your CRM opportunities that are ready to be sent to partners.
Without any configuration, this tab lists all your CRM opportunities.
You can click the filter button to specify various filters to narrow down the scope:
You can also use the search box on the top right:
Share an Opportunity
​
Below is an example where we share a Salesforce opportunity with AWS.
Find an opportunity from the Outbox.
Click on the opportunity name (in
teal
color) which navigates to the detail page.
Click the
share
button on the top right.
In the pop-up dialog, fill in required fields. Also fill in optional fields as you need.
If all validation passed, the
Submit
button will be clickable. Click on it.
Suger sends this to AWS. This process usually takes ~5 seconds but sometimes it takes longer.
The shared opportunity will be moved to the "In Sync" tab.
You can click on it to check the details. You should see the "APN CRM Unique Identifier" in the "Destination" section on the bottom.
Bulk Share
​
You can share multiple opportunities at the same time.
This can be very efficient if your CRM data is in good quality (e.g., all postal codes are filled)
and the field mappings & templates are well-configured.
Click the
Bulk Share
button to enter the selection mode.
Select those you want to share and click
Submit
.
A dialog will pop out showing the AWS opportunity we are about to submit.
You can click on any of them to check the details.
If all validation passed, you can click the
Submit
button. Otherwise you'll need to manually fill them.
