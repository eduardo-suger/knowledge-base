Google Bigquery
Allow Suger to query or update the data in your GCP Bigquery tables.
Overview
​
Google BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless, highly-scalable cloud data warehouse and analytics platform offered by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It is designed to handle massive datasets and enable fast SQL queries using a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
By connecting Suger to your Google Bigquery, we can build customized automation workflow in usage metering, financial report, or notifications.
Create Integration
​
Create a service account
in your target GCP project for bigquery service.
Grant necessary IAM roles to the service account. Some suggested options include:
Bigquery Admin
Bigquery User
Bigquery Data Viewer
Create the service account key
, and download the associated JSON file.
Store the content of the key JSON file within the Suger console integration page.
Edit Integration
​
Editing an existing Bigquery integration is not supported. The practical way is to delete it and then re-create it from beginning.
Delete Integration
​
The Bigquery integration can be deleted like all other integrations. Once the deletion is triggered, all integration info including the service account with the key will be deleted immediately & permanently from Suger. No time window or methods to recover.
warning
To completely delete the integration, please delete the service account and the key as well.
