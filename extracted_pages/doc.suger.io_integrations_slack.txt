Receive instant Suger notifications and alerts in your Slack workspace.
Overview
​
By connecting with Suger app for Slack in your Slack workspace, you and your team can get instant notifications & alerts as soon as possible if any important sales operations are happening cross your cloud marketplaces.
Create Integration
​
In your
Suger Console
, navigate to the 'Integrations' panel. On this page, you will see the Slack integration connection status. Click the
Connect
button to install the Suger app for Slack. This will redirect you to Slack's website. If you are not yet logged in to your Slack workspace, you will be prompted to first login.
Once you are authenticated, you will be asked to allow the Suger app for slack to access your workspace. You must provide a Slack channel (e.g. #suger-alerts) created ahead of time to receive Suger notifications in. Click the
Allow
button:
Once the installation is complete, you should receive a notification in your Slack workspace that the app was successfully installed. Your browser will be redirected to your Suger console, indicating the Slack integration status as
connected
. Click Verify, your slack channel will receive a verification message from Suger app, and the integration status is updated as
verified
.
warning
If you choose a
private channel
for Suger notifications or set it to private after integrating, you must invite the
Suger app
to the channel; otherwise, the
Suger bot
won't be able to send messages.
How to invite
Suger app
to the
private channel
is shown below.
Configure Notification
​
Once you've connected the Suger app to your Slack workspace, you cannot directly modify the authentication scopes. The recommended approach is to delete the app and then re-install it in the same Slack workspace.
You are allowed to edit the notification configurations below:
Enable Notification
: Enable or disable the notification in the Slack channel by toggling the switch.
Notification Scope Configs
: You can configure the notification scopes and their corresponding destination slack channels. To add a new scope, click
Add notification scope
.
Delete Integration
​
The Slack integration can be deleted like all other integrations. Once the deletion is triggered, all integration info including the access token will be deleted immediately & permanently from Suger. No time window or methods to recover.
warning
To completely delete the integration, please uninstall the Suger app from
your slack workspace
.
