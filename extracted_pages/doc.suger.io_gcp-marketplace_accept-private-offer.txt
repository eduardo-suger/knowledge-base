Guidance to accept the private offer as the end buyer in GCP marketplace
Overview
​
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to accept a private offer on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) marketplace. It explains the process of reviewing and accepting the offer, checking the start and end dates, and understanding the usage metrics. It also guides users through the signup process, including filling out the necessary fields and upgrading their account.
Before you begin
​
To accept private offer in GCP marketplace, you must have the one of following Identity and Access Management (IAM) role(s):
Billing Administrator
(roles/billing.admin)
OR
Billing User
(roles/billing.user) AND
Consumer Procurement Order Administrator
(roles/consumerprocurement.orderAdmin)
If you don't have the correct role(s), request access from a Billing Administrator or Organization Administrator. For information and steps on granting roles, see

In the confirmation window, click

Depending on the product, you might need to activate your subscription directly with the vendor.
After you subscribe, the vendor is prompted to accept the offer. The offer pricing takes effect on the contract start date, as outlined in the offer.
Accept offer with auto-renew
​
If the vendor has configured auto-renew, you can enable the private offer to automatically renew at the end of the contract. If you turn on auto-renew, the renewed offer uses the same contract duration as the current offer. For offers that charge based on your usage, the renewed offer might include changes in usage metric pricing if the vendor has updated their public pricing plan. Otherwise, the renewed offer has the same pricing as the current offer.
To turn on or turn off auto-renew, see
Manage your accepted offers
