Quick Start Guide for Suger Java SDK
Follow these steps to get started with the Suger Java SDK:
Step 1: Add Maven Dependency
​
To include the Suger SDK in your project, add the following dependency to your
pom.xml
file:
<
dependency
>
<
groupId
>
io.suger.sdk
</
groupId
>
<
artifactId
>
suger-java-client
</
artifactId
>
<
version
>
{{latest.version}}
</
version
>
</
dependency
>
Step 2: Create a Client
​
Once you have added the dependency, you can create a client instance. Here’s how to do it:
public
ApiClient
client
(
String
yourApiKey
)
{
ApiClient
apiClient
=
new
ApiClient
(
)
;
apiClient
.
setBasePath
(
"https://api.suger.cloud"
)
;
ApiKeyAuth
APIKeyAuth
=
(
ApiKeyAuth
)
apiClient
.
getAuthentication
(
"APIKeyAuth"
)
;
APIKeyAuth
.
setApiKey
(
"Key "
+
yourApiKey
)
;
return
apiClient
;
}
Step 3: Use the Client
​
Now that you have your client set up, you can call Suger services. Here’s a simple example of how to make a service call:
public
WorkloadOffer
getOffer
(
ApiClient
client
,
String
orgId
,
String
offerId
)
throws
ApiException
{
OfferApi
offerApi
=
new
OfferApi
(
client
)
;
return
offerApi
.
getOffer
(
orgId
,
offerId
)
;
}
