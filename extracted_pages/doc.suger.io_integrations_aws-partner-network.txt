AWS Partner Network
Sync leads & opportunities with AWS Partner Network (APN) for co-sell.
Overview
‚Äã
By integrating with programs such as
APN Customer Engagement
(ACE) and ISV Accelerate, ISV/Sellers can scale their co-sell programs more effectively. The integration streamlines the process of managing information about leads and opportunities, reducing manual efforts and eliminating the need to maintain data in two separate systems, such as the Salesforce CRM and AWS Partner Central.
Through the integration, ISV/Sellers can easily manage new opportunities and leads. They can accept new opportunities and leads, receive updates on them from AWS, and send new opportunities and updates on their leads and opportunities to AWS. All of these actions are supported by an AWS-managed S3 bucket, which acts as an intermediary in the bi-directional exchange of files.
Request CRM Integration on AWS Partner Central
‚Äã
Before integrating your ACE pipeline with Suger, you first need to initiate an onboarding request on
CRM Integration self-service portal
.
info
This can only be done by
Alliance Lead
This process involves creating
AWS IAM Roles
so you may need to involve your
Cloud Ops
if you do not have the permissions on your AWS Console.
[AWS Console] Create AWS IAM Role
Create two empty IAM roles, one for sandbox/test environment, and the other for production environment.
The name can be arbitrary. A common name is
APN-ACE-{company}-AccessRole-beta
and
APN-ACE-{company}-AccessRole-prod
.
You can click
this link
to create the roles via our CloudFormation stack.
The only purpose of these roles is to access the S3 buckets which are created and owned by APN. They won't need any access to your company's resources.
Navigate to
CRM Integration self-service portal
and click
Initiate Onboarding Request
button on the bottom.
Step 1 - Enter basic information
Partner CRM system - Choose Salesforce or HubSpot.
What solution would you be using to integrate your CRM with APN? - Choose "Third Party Solution".
Name of the third party solution provider - Suger
Estimated integration start date - choose the next Monday or the date you prefer.
Step 2 - Enter partner contacts
Third party contact:
Email:
support@suger.io
Partner Role: Third Party Staff
Step 3 - Enter the ARN for the role you created
Step 4 - Set up Sandbox
APN will set up a sandbox bucket, and generate a policy JSON doc to access it.
Copy the JSON content and attach it to the sandbox role you created in AWS console.
Then you can mark it as completed.
Step 5 - Set up Production
After you mark implementation completed and UAT passed, proceed to the next step
and APN will provision the production bucket, with another JSON policy doc.
Similar to the sandbox, copy & attach it to the production role in AWS console.
Step 6 - Launch
Click the "Submit" button. APN will show that the CRM integration has been "Launched".
After all the steps, you will now have:
A production S3 bucket provisioned and owned by APN.
An IAM role that have access to the bucket.
The sandbox role is created only because APN requested for it. It will not be used by Suger.
info
The bucket name contains your "Partner ID" and region as well. The format is
ace-apn-{PartnerID}-prod-{Region}
.
E.g., if your bucket name is
ace-apn-12345678-prod-us-west-2
, then:
Your "Partner ID" is
12345678
Your Bucket region is
us-west-2
Now you need to create the ACE integration on Suger Console to delegate the user/role to Suger, so our automated pipelines can manage it for you.
Create Integration on Suger
‚Äã
Visit the
integration page of Suger console
, click the button 'Connect' in the
AWS ACE
integration card. There are four fields to input.
AWS IAM Role ARN
: It is
APN-ACE-{partnerName}-AccessRole-prod
created in the previous step.
AWS S3 Bucket Name
: The Name of the S3 bucket provisioned by AWS ACE team.
AWS Partner ID
: The number in your bucket name.
AWS S3 Bucket Region
: The AWS region of the S3 bucket provisioned by AWS ACE team - also in the bucket name.
After the connection is created, click the button
Verify
to finish the verification of the AWS ACE integration. Then all set.
Provide More Details
‚Äã
After the integration is created and verified, we need to collect a little more information:
ACE Program
Solution Offering
You need to click the
üñäÔ∏èEdit
button on ACE integration and input the information there:
Solution Offering
‚Äã
Since November 2023, ACE requires all partners to specify "Solution Offerings" when sharing opportunities with AWS.
You can register or check your offerings at
Partner Central
.
Make sure the "Offering status" is shown as ‚úÖActive.
Open the offering,
copy
the "Offering ID" located at the top left:
Then, input the offering ID and hit
Enter
, and click
Save
.
Delete Integration
‚Äã
If you need to delete the
AWS Partner Network
integration, you can do so like any other integration. Once the deletion is triggered, all integration information, including the access token, will be immediately and permanently deleted from Suger. Please note that there is no time window or any means of recovering the deleted data.
