processed successfully. 2. The combination of a successful RPC status and a
non-empty
report_errors

Operations
in the request succeeded. Each
Operation
that failed
processing has a corresponding item in this list. 3. A failed RPC status
indicates a general non-deterministic failure. When this happens, it's
impossible to know which of the 'Operations' in the request succeeded or
failed.
