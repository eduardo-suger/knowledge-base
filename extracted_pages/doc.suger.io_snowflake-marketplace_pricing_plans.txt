Pricing Plans
Overview
​
Snowflake Marketplace offers two primary pricing models:
Usage-Based
and
Subscription-Based
. You can implement one or both models for your product listing.
Usage-Based Pricing
​
Usage-based pricing charges consumers monthly based on their actual consumption of your data product. This model offers several charging options:
1. Billable Events
​
Note: Custom Event Billing is only available for application listings.
Custom Event Billing allows you to charge for specific application usage patterns, such as:
Per row modified
Per procedure call
Per row accessed
Per unique row updated monthly (monthly active rows)
Custom-defined events in your application
2. Per-Query Charges
​
Fixed price per query accessing paid data
Applies in addition to any monthly fees (if applicable)
3. Monthly Fee
​
Fixed calendar month fee
Triggered by:
First query execution against a Snowflake Native App
First access to paid listing data share
First run of a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services
Not prorated; full month charged regardless of activation date
No charge if no usage occurs during the month
Usage-Based Pricing Requirements
​
For plans with dynamic charges (per-query or Custom Event Billing), you must specify:
Maximum Monthly Charge Cap
Defines the upper limit for total monthly costs
Includes all usage-based charges
Usage becomes free once cap is reached
Free Query Allowance
First query always incurs charges
Specify number of free queries after the first query
Regular pricing resumes after free queries are used
Subscription-Based Pricing
​
Subscription-based pricing requires upfront payment for a specified term. Two billing options are available:
Recurring Billing
Automatic renewal at term end
Continuous access to data product
Non-Recurring Billing
Fixed-term access
Manual renewal required
Installment Plan Options
​
To provide payment flexibility, you can offer installment plans that:
Split total cost into multiple payments
Allow customized payment schedules
Variable payment amounts
Front-loaded or back-loaded payments
Optional zero-payment periods
