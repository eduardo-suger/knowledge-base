Use Suger to sell and co-sell within your Salesforce
Overview
​
Most functionalities provided by Suger Console, including both marketplace transactions
and co-sell, can also be accessed within Salesforce. Below are the steps:
Install our Salesforce package - Suger Connector.
Set up the integrator user in Salesforce.
Set up the connection in both Suger Console and Salesforce.
Set up the UI component -
Suger Opportunity Quick Panel
.
Assign the permission set to target users.
Package Installation
​
Please install
Suger Connector
via Salesforce AppExchange.
Set up Integration User
​
We need a integration user (aka. integrator) to access your Salesforce data.
We use
OAuth 2.0 Web Server Flow
for authentication, and communicate
with your Salesforce instance using REST APIs on behalf of the integrator.
When creating the integration user, please use either the
Salesforce
or
Salesforce Integration
license.
If your field mapping involves CPQ Quote (
SBQQ__Quote__c
), you will have to use the
Salesforce
license and grant the integration user the CPQ license.
In most other cases, we recommend using the
Salesforce Integration
license with the
Salesforce API Only System Integrations
profile, since this license is free.
Please also make sure you use a correct email address and can activate the user.
After creation, please assign the permission sets.
If you use the
Salesforce
license
:
Assign the
Suger Integrator
permission set.
Create a new permission set to grant the integrator user
Read
and
View All
permissions on the following standard objects:
Account
Contact
Opportunity
Any other objects/fields that may be used in field mapping.
If you use the
Salesforce Integration
license
:
Assign the
Suger Integrator (Salesforce Integration License)
permission set.
Create a new permission set to grant the integrator user
Read
and
View All
permissions on the following standard objects:
Account
Contact
Opportunity
Any other objects/fields that may be used in field mapping.
When creating this permission set, be sure to
Salesforce API Integration
as the license. Note that it is
Salesforce API Integration
, NOT
Salesforce Integration
.
Get Connected
​
After the installation, perform the following steps so that Salesforce and Suger can talk with each other.
Allow Salesforce to Access Suger
​
Get your Suger Organization ID and API Key
Organization ID
- This can be found at Suger Console Settings (
https://console.suger.io/settings
)
API Key
- Follow the instructions at
API Client
warning
Please make sure to use the
API_KEY
as opposed to the
BEARER_TOKEN
Input the organization ID and key on Suger App.
Go to the Suger app on Salesforce
Go to "Settings" and fill in the required information and click
💾Save
Please ensure the API Key doesn't contain any trailing spaces.
Allow Suger to Access Salesforce
​
Go to the "Integrations" page in your Suger Console, locate "Salesforce" and click "Connect":
warning
Before you proceed, we suggest you log out of Salesforce just in case the browser cached your current session without asking you to log in as the integrator.
Note that if you are just playing around with a sandbox instance, remember to check "This is a sandbox instance".
A new window will pop up to verify your identity:
Click "Allow" to grant Suger access. After successfully logging in, the window will disappear and the "Status" will become "CREATED".
Now locate the integration in the "Integrations" table, and click "Verify".
We will attempt to read a few records to ensure the integration is ready.
Once confirmed, the status will turn into "VERIFIED", and you are all set!
Enable the Suger Widget on Opportunity Lightning Page
​
Edit the Opportunity Lightning Record Page:
On the left, locate the “Suger Opportunity Quick Panel” component:
Drag and drop the component to the desired location.
The
New Offer
and
Co-sell
buttons will get you started to sell and co-sell 🚀
Assign Permission Set to Target Users
​
You need to grant your team the correct permission set so that they can invoke the
Suger functionalities properly. We provide 3 permission sets:
Suger User - Marketplace
: user will only see the marketplace-related buttons, like
New Offer
.
Suger User - Cosell
: user will only see buttons for co-sell.
Suger User
: all functionalities available.
For example, if you assign Jane Doe the
Suger User - Cosell
permission set, she
could only see the
Co-sell
button on the opportunity Suger Widget:
Under the hood, these buttons' visibility is controlled by the following Custom Permissions (under the
Suger
namespace):
Create Offer
Create Referral
.
If you have assigned Jane Doe the
Suger User - Cosell
permission set, but she is still able to see the
New Offer
button, please check the following:
Check the user profile.
When you install Suger Connector the first time, Salesforce may automatically enable the Custom Permissions on the User Profile level.
Ask the target user to force-refresh the page with
Cmd+r
or
Ctrl+Shift+r
.
Delete Integration
​
To delete the integration, simply click the 🗑️ button in the "Integrations" list. We will remove any credentials in our system.
You can also revoke all access by going to your Salesforce Setup page -> Connected Apps OAuth Usage,
click the "User Count" which is normally "1", and then click "Revoke" or "Revoke All".
