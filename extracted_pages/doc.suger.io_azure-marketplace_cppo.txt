Create and manage Azure Marketplace Channel Partner Private Offer (CPPO) in Suger
Overview
​
The CPPO (Channel Partner Private Offer) is a sales model offered by Azure cloud platforms, allowing Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) to sell their software or services through channel partners. There are two types of CPPO.
The CSP Partner Private Offer
(also known as margin sharing) is a private offer type that is designed to motivate eligible partners to sell an ISV's solution. ISVs can make private offers and extend a margin to partners in the Cloud Solution Provider program (CSPs).
The Multiparty Private Offer
enables multiple partners, including ISVs and other resellers, to collaborate and create a unified custom offer for a customer.
