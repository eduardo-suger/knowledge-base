Usage Metering V2
Advanced usage metering service to empower your complex usage-based business models across all cloud marketplaces with unified interfaces and easy configurations.
Overview
​
Compared with
the 1st version
of Suger usage metering service, the V2 can support much more complex and flexible usage-based pricing model, including:
Filters
Group Bys
Aggregation types:
COUNT
,
UNIQUE COUNT
,
MAX
,
SUM
,
LATEST
Various pricing models:
Basic
,
Tiered
,
Bulk
,
Volume
,
Percentage
and
Matrix
Apply minimum spend
Discount
Credit
To define and apply your usage-based pricing model on cloud marketplaces, follow these three steps:
Define billable metrics based on your pricing model, and set up the mapping between the billable metric and the usage dimension key defined in the cloud marketplace.
Define billable dimensions (based on billable metrics) in the default or private offers, set up the detailed price, minimum spend, discount if applicable.
Report usage records through the Suger metering API.
Create Billable Metrics
​
Follow the instructions in
Billable Metrics
.
Update Usage Metering Configs
​
We need to create mapping between Billable Metric and Dimension Key which was defined on marketplace.
Add Billable Dimensions in Offer
​
After the Billable Metric was created, we can use it to create Billable Dimension when we create the offer.
Multiple billable dimensions can be configured in one Offer. It should be noted that within one offer, the same billable metric can only be used by one billable dimension.
Price Model
​
Basic pricing
​
In a basic price model, each unit of a product or service is assigned a fixed cost.
For example, consider a company offering cloud storage services at a rate of $0.5 per gigabyte (GB).
In this scenario, the
unit amount
is set to $0.5, indicating that each gigabyte of storage incurs a charge of $0.5.
for 100 units,
10 x 0.5(unit amount) = 5
, $5 in total.
Tiered pricing
​
In tiered pricing, the cost of a given unit depends on the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound.
For example, the first 5 GB may cost $0.5 each, for 6 to 10 GB each unit cost $0.3 and all units thereafter may cost $0.2 each.
Tier Range (GB)
Price per GB ($)
1 - 5
$0.5
6 - 10
$0.3
11+
$0.2
for 4 units,
4 x 0.5 = 2
, $2 in total.
for 8 units,
5 x 0.5 + 3 x 0.3 = 3.4
, $3.4 in total.
for 15 units,
5 x 0.5 + 5 * 0.3 + 5 * 0.2 = 5
, $5 in total.
Bulk pricing
​
Bulk pricing applies when the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
For example, if the bulk size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5 and 6 units will be billed at 10.
Bulk Size
Bulk Amount
5
$5
for 4 units price
1 x 5(bulk amount) = 5
, $5 in total.
for 6 units price
2 x 5(bulk amount) = 10
, $10 in total.
Volume pricing
​
Volume pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
Number of Units
Price per Unit ($)
Flat Fee ($)
1 - 10
$0.50
$5.00
11+
$0.40
$0.00
For example, if you've bought 8 units, total price will be
8 x 0.5(unit price) + 5(flat fee) = 9
, $9 in total.
Once you've bought more than 10 units, say 15 units, the total price will be
15 x 0.4(unit price) + 0.0(flat fee) = 6
, $6 in total.
Percentage pricing
​
Percentage pricing applies when a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a percent.
For example, if the price is set as following
Percentage rate
Flat Fee ($)
0.25
$3.00
for payment of $100, the charge will be
100 x 0.25(percentage rate) + 3(flat fee) = 27
, $27 in total.
Tiered percentage pricing
​
Tiered percentage pricing apples when a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth
of a percent with several tiers.
For example, if the price is set as following
Number of Units
Percentage rate
Flat Fee ($)
1 - 10
0.25
$3.00
11+
0.2
$1.00
for payment of 9, the charge will be
9 x 0.25(percentage rate) + 3(flat fee) = 5.25
, $5.25 in total.
for payment of 20, the charge will be
10 x 0.25(percentage rate) + 3(flat fee) + 10 x 0.20(percentage rate) + 1(flat fee) = 8.5
, $8.5 in total.
Matrix pricing
​
Matrix pricing applies when the cost of a unit depends on the combination of two or more properties.
For example, if the billable metric named
disk_usage
with aggregation type of
SUM
.
Group price is set as following.
Matrix Group
Property 1
Property 2
Price per Unit ($)
1
partner = aws
region = east
$0.5
2
partner = aws
region = west
$0.3
3
partner = gcp
$0.4
default
$0.2
for usage records:
[
{
"key": "disk_usage",
"quantity": 10,
"properties": {
"region": "west",
"os": "arm",
"partner": "aws"
}
},
{
"key": "disk_usage",
"quantity": 10,
"properties": {
"region": "west",
"os": "arm",
"partner": "azure"
}
},
{
"key": "disk_usage",
"quantity": 2.5,
"properties": {
"region": "east",
"os": "arm",
"partner": "gcp"
}
},
{
"key": "disk_usage",
"quantity": 2.5,
"properties": {
"region": "west",
"os": "arm",
"partner": "gcp"
}
},
{
"key": "disk_usage",
"quantity": 10,
"properties": {
"region": "west",
"os": "linux",
"partner": "aws"
}
},
{
"key": "disk_usage",
"quantity": 2.5,
"properties": {
"region": "east",
"os": "arrch",
"partner": "gcp"
}
},
{
"key": "disk_usage",
"quantity": 2.5,
"properties": {
"region": "west",
"os": "x86",
"partner": "gcp"
}
}
]
For Group1 of partner=aws,region=east, no records, amount is
0
.
For Group2 of partner=aws,region=west, quantity sum is 20, amount is
20 * 0.3 = 6
.
For Group3 of partner=gcp, quantity sum is 10, amount is
10 * 0.4 = 4
.
For Group Default, quantity sum is 10, amount is
10 * 0.2 = 2
.
Total charge will be
0 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 12
.
Minimum Spend and Discount
​
We can set Minimum Spend and Discount for each Billable Dimension.
Meter Usage Records
​
After an entitlement was created which contains Billable Dimensions, we can start metering usages.
Your service can send a
POST
request to the
Suger Metering API
with a body similar to the following example. Suger will validate, aggregate & report them to the right vendor within the right pricing model format.
{
"ID": "uuid", # optional, if not provided, suger will generate one and return in the response.
"organizationID": "your-suger-org-id",
"entitlementID": "your-suger-entitlement-id",
"billableRecords": [
{
"key": "billable-metric-id-in-the-entitlment's-billable-dimension",
"properties": {
"custom-property-1": "val1",
"custom-property-2": "val2"
},
"quantity": 10
}
]
}
