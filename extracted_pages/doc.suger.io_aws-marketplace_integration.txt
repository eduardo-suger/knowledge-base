Edit Integration

Editing an existing AWS integration is not supported. The practical way is to delete it and then re-connect it with new inputs.
Delete Integration
​
The AWS integration can be deleted like all other integrations. Once the deletion icon is clicked & confirmed, the integration info will be deleted immediately & permanently from Suger. No time window or methods to recover.
warning
To completely delete the
IAM Role
created for Suger, please visit your
AWS CloudFormation
, and delete the stack
SugerAccessMarketplaceStack
, which will remove all resources including
IAM Role
created for Suger.
Multiple Integrations
​
It is supported to have multiple AWS Marketplace integrations under the same Suger organization, with each integration operating independently. To set up multiple AWS Marketplace integrations, please contact the
Suger Support
.
Once set up, you will see multiple integrations listed on the Suger Console integration page. Each integration can be edited or deleted individually.
There are no changes to the process of creating private offers, reporting usage records, or generating revenue reports across the Suger web console, Salesforce app, and HubSpot app. All connections for each integration are automatically managed by the Suger service.
