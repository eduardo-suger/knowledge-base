CPPO
Create and manage AWS marketplace Channel Partner Private Offer (CPPO) in Suger service
Overview
​
The
Channel Partner Private Offer
(CPPO) empowers Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) to grant Channel Partners access to wholesale pricing for their software solutions. This functionality enables ISVs to delegate the financial and contractual aspects of customer relationships within the AWS Marketplace to their Channel Partners.
Within the Suger platform, ISVs/Sellers can efficiently oversee
CPPO resell opportunities
,
CPPO private offers
, and
CPPO entitlements
in a unified manner. Additionally,
CPPO entitlements
benefit from overage usage metering support when the relevant usage metering dimensions are available.
Requirements
​
The service-linked role for AWS Marketplace is required to enable CPPO function in Suger platform. AWS Marketplace uses the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForMarketplaceResaleAuthorization, which enables access to AWS services and resources used or managed by AWS Marketplace for Resale Authorizations. Here is the steps to set up the
service-linked role for AWS Marketplace
:
In the
AWS Marketplace Management Portal
, sign in to the management account and choose Settings.
In the Settings section, select the Service-linked roles tab.
On the Service-linked roles page, select Service-linked role for Resale Authorizations or Resale Authorizations integration, and then choose Create service-linked role or Configure integration.
On the Service-linked role for Resale Authorizations or Create Resale Authorizations integrations page, review the information and confirm by choosing Create service-linked role or Create integration. A message appears on the Service-linked roles page, indicating that the Resale Authorization service-linked role was successfully created.
