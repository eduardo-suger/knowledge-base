Operations on Entitlements.
Terminate an entitlement
​
You can schedule a cancellation of an entitlement. There are three cancellation types supported:
Immediate: The entitlement will be terminated immediately.
End of Term: The entitlement will be terminated at the end of current term.
Specific Date: The entitlement will be terminated at a specific date.
When an entitlement terminates, Suger will automatically calculate charges for any outstanding usage and generate the final invoice.
For commitment charging terms:
If the payment schedule is
postpay
, a final invoice will be generated with the prorated days.
If the payment schedule is
prepay
, a refund will be made for the unused period.
Apply an Addon
​
You can apply an addon to an entitlement if you need to charge the customer an additional amount.
Alert before the end date of an entitlement
​
Sellers can configure the
alertDaysBeforeEnd
field in the entitlement configuration to send an alert to both the seller and the customer before the end date of an entitlement. The
alertDaysBeforeEnd
field can be set to 15 or 45 days.
Auto-renew an entitlement
​
Sellers can configure the
autoRenew
field in the entitlement configuration to automatically renew the entitlement at the end date. The
autoRenew
field can be set to either
true
or
false
.
If set to
true
, the entitlement will be automatically renewed at the end date.
If set to
false
, the entitlement will not be automatically renewed.
