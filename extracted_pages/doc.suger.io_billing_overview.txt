Overview
Quick guide to start with Suger's billing system.
Billing workflow
​
1. Create product
​
Create a product to represent your sellable product or service. When create the product, select Stripe as partner because Suger will use Stripe to collect payments.
2. Define billable metrics
​
If you want to use usage based pricing, you need to define the
billable metrics
for the product you created in the previous step. They will be used in price models when creating offers and reporting usage data.
3. Create buyer
​
Create a
buyer
to represent your customer. You can set the billing address, currency, and other information for the buyer.
4. Create and send offer
​
Create a
offer
including price models and send it to your customer. You can configure the contract duration, billing interval, flat fee, and usage metering and other details in the offer.
Send the offer to your customer, if the customer accepts the offer, a entitlement will be created.
5. Manage entitlement
​
You can view the
entitlement
just created, track the usage and billing status. Edit or cancel it when needed.
6. Report usage data
​
Report
usage metering
data to Suger using the API or SDK. Suger will aggregate the usage data periodically which will be used to calculate the charges.
7. Invoicing
​
Invoices
will be generated automatically for each entitlement according to price models in it. There are several types of invoices including installments, recurring commitments, usage based and one-time.
8. Payments
​
Suger will process
payments
automatically to collect money from the buyer via Stripe when the invoice is due. The money collected will be deposited to your Stripe account.
9. Revenue
​
Revenue reports
will be generated for each entitlement and also aggregated by product and buyer.
