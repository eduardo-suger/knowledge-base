Guidance to accept the private offer as the end buyer in Azure marketplace
Overview
​
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to accept a private offer on Azure marketplace. It explains the process of reviewing and accepting the offer, checking the start and end dates, and understanding the usage metrics. It also guides users through the signup process.
Before you begin
​
To accept a private offer on the Microsoft commercial marketplace, the buyer must meet the following prerequisites:
The
Enterprise Agreement Admin
or
Billing Account Owner
role is required to accept the private offer terms.
Holding the
Owner
or
Contributor
role in the organization's main Azure Account on the subscription (not Marketplace account) is essential to subscribe to the private offer.
The buyer needs to be logged into the Azure account designated in the private offer.
The Microsoft private offer should be based on a public plan that is available in the buyer's market. When creating a private offer, verify the market location of the buyer's billing account and select the appropriate market.

Once you complete any necessary prechecks, check permissions, and have your
billing account ID
ready, you're ready to accept a private offer.

Plans included in the offer
Private offer price
Custom legal terms for the offer, if applicable
Start and end dates when the negotiated price applies to this offer
Expiration date for the offer; you must accept the offer before this date
