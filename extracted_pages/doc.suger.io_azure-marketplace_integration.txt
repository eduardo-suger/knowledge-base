Grant Suger the necessary access to manage your Azure Marketplace on hour behalf, no more no less.
Overview
​
Selling on Azure Marketplace is managed through
Microsoft Partner Center
. Your business is required to enroll and get a verifed

tip
To enable
App + User authentication
through Suger for connecting to Azure Marketplace APIs, it is required to provide the User ID (the email address you use to log in to Microsoft Partner Center) and User Secret (the password you use to log in to Microsoft Partner Center), so we can securely verify your identity and complete the process.
Once clicked the button
CREATE
, you are redirected to Azure auth portal to grant OAuth code for the
Application
& Suger service.
Edit Integration
​
Editing an existing Azure integration is not supported. The practical way is to delete it and then re-connect it with new inputs.
Delete Integration
​
The Azure integration can be deleted like all other integrations. Once the deletion is triggered, all integration info including the
Application Key
will be deleted immediately & permanently from Suger. No time window or methods to recover.
