Create and manage GCP marketplace Channel Partner Private Offer (CPPO) in Suger service
Create and manage reseller private offer plans of GCP marketplace in Suger service
Overview
​
The
Channel Partner Private Offer
(CPPO, or reseller private offer plans in GCP Marketplace) empowers Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) to grant Channel Partners access to wholesale pricing for their software solutions. This functionality enables ISVs to delegate the financial and contractual aspects of customer relationships within the GCP Marketplace to their Channel Partners.
Within the Suger, ISVs/Sellers can efficiently oversee
CPPO_OUT
(reseller private offer plans of GCP marketplace),
CPPO private offers
, and
CPPO entitlements
in a unified manner. Additionally,
CPPO entitlements
benefit from overage usage metering support when the relevant usage metering dimensions are available.
