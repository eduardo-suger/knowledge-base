Google Mail
Allow Suger to access your Gmail account to send, receive, and manage emails on your behalf.
Overview
​
Gmail, Google's email service, offers a comprehensive platform for communication and productivity.
With features like advanced search capabilities, powerful filters, and seamless integration with other Google Workspace tools,
Gmail is a cornerstone of modern email management.
By integrating Suger with Gmail, users can leverage automation workflows to enhance email productivity.
Tasks such as sending emails, applying labels for organization, and managing threads can be automated, improving efficiency and enabling customized email workflows tailored to specific needs.
Create Integration
​
Authenticate by OAuth2.0 (Recommended)
​
Click the
Connect Now
button, select
OAuth2.0
as the authentication method, and click
Create
. You will be redirected to the Google OAuth2.0 authentication page.
Click the
Allow
button to grant Suger permission to access your Gmail account. This authorization enables Suger to send emails on your behalf.
After the authorization is granted, you will be redirected to the Suger console. You can see the integration is connected successfully.
Verify the integration by clicking the
Verify
button. If the integration is successful, you will see the
Verified
status.
Authenticate by a Service Account
​
Create a service account
in your target GCP project for Google Mail integration.
info
Grant the service account with the IAM role
Service Account Token Creator
under the GCP project.
Enable the Gmail API
in the same Google project.
Create the service account key
, and download the associated JSON file. It is required for the following integration.
Enable G-Suite Domain-wide Delegation
for the service account.
info
In the "OAuth Scopes" field, only select the scope
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send
.
Specify the impersonated email address, select the appropriate scopes configured in the previous step, and store the JSON key file contents within the Suger console integration page.
info
Enter the Impersonation Email (an user email from your company) that Suger will impersonate to send emails on behalf of the user.
It MUST be user email, instead of group email
, since the group email can't be impersonated.
Select only the scope
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send
.
Edit Integration
​
For security purpose, editing an existing Google Mail integration is not allowed. The practical way is to delete it and then re-create it from beginning.
Delete Integration
​
The Google Mail integration can be deleted like all other integrations. Once the deletion is triggered, all integration info including the service account with the key will be deleted immediately & permanently from Suger. No time window or methods to recover.
warning
To completely delete the integration, please delete the service account and the key as well.
